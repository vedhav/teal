<p><code>teal</code> is a modular framework that relies on a suite of
related R packages, as illustrated in the above diagram, to provide a
wide range of functionalities.</p>
<p><code>teal</code>â€™s primary function is to create web app for
analysing clinical trial data but it <strong>has</strong> a multitude of
features distributed across various R packages.</p>
<p>Developers can selectively leverage these R packages, such as
<code>teal.widgets</code>, <code>teal.code</code>, and
<code>teal.logger</code>, to <strong>build</strong> <code>teal</code>
modules for a <code>teal</code> app. This approach gives the developers
the tools that speed up their work and avoid re-implementing existing
logic and UI elements.</p>
<p>The <code>teal</code> modules utilize various R packages such as
<code>tern</code>, <code>osprey</code>, and <code>goshawk</code> to
perform calculations and analyses. These R packages provide
<strong>support</strong> to the <code>teal</code> modules by performing
all computations while the modules only have to focus on how to wrap the
input options and the output.</p>
<p>Once developed, new and existing modules can be integrated into
<code>teal</code> to <strong>create</strong> a functional
<code>teal</code> app.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="why-so-many-r-packages">Why so many R packages?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-so-many-r-packages"></a>
</h2>
<p>By breaking down <code>teal</code> features, modules, and
calculations into dedicated R packages, maintenance is made
significantly more manageable.</p>
<p>Additionally, this separation allows for a clear distinction between
the various roles and actors involved in the development of
<code>teal</code>.</p>
<p>To learn different roles/actors in <code>teal</code> development,

<p>Below, you can explore the network graph for a comprehensive list of
the package dependencies that surround the Teal framework. Each node
represents a package, and the connecting arrow depicts the dependency
relationship from one package to another</p>
